    <h1>Hi!</h1>
    <h2>I'm Richard, you can call me RJ.</h2>
    <h3>And this is my website.</h3>
    <p>I have been learning to program for the past 2 years.  It has been an incredibly rewarding and enjoyable journey, starting with a basic Intro course on <em><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">codecademy</a></em>, then taking some excellent courses on Udemy, such as Angela Yu's <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/">Python</a> and <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/">Web Development</a> courses, and Colt Steele's <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">Web Development</a> course.  And no self-study experience is complete without scouring google searches and stackoverflow after staring at a problem for half an hour.  I've only just begun to scratch the surface of the Web Development landscape, and I look forward to learning new and modern technologies to help me grow.</p>

    <h3>B. C. (before coding)</h3>
    <p>Before I began this journey in to programming, I worked in a variety of fields ranging from food service, to retail, to logistics and distribution.  My most recent position as a Shipping Lead at Tradewinds Climate Systems inspired me to create my first major Python project, the <a href="/public/wim.html">Warehouse Inventory Manager</a>.  Not only was it my first major project to add to my portfolio, but it was something that I used daily to help streamline the shipping process and be far more efficient with my time.  Wherever I have been, I have always strived to be the best version of me, and a valued member of any team I am on</p>

    <h3>Work Smarter, Play Harder</h3>
    <p>When I am not studying and coding, I like to take it easy and spend time with my amazing wife and our little frenchton, Tucker.  I love to play all sorts of games, both solo and with friends.  Some of my all-time favorites are:
        <ul>
            <li>World of Warcraft</li>
            <li>Stardew Valley</li>
            <li>Banjo Kazooie</li>
            <li>Starcraft 2</li>
            <li>Destiny 1 & 2</li>
            <li>Mass Effect</li>
            <li>Rollercoaster Tycoon</li>
        </ul>
        We love to travel, with our favorite spots being Virginia Beach, and the Sherando Lake in Virginia.
